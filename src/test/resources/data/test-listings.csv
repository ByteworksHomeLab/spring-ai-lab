I attended The University of Texas at Austin and fell in love with the small town that it was back in 1979; I have been here every since.  I love the Art, Music and Film scene here in Austin.  There is so much natural beauty to enjoy as well. I especially enjoy Barton Springs Pool in the summertime along with the Zilker Hillside theater productions. SXSW, Austin City Limits Festival and the East Austin Art Studio Tour are among my favorite events. I also enjoy a sunset cruise on my canoe to Congress bridge to see the Mexican Freetail Bats come out for their nightly feeding.
